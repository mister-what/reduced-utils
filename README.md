console.log(myObject) // {someProp: "value"}
console.log(nextObject) // {someProp: "value", some: {deep: {value: "Hello World"}}}

combineReducers(
  reducers: {
    [sliceName: string]: (
      state: Object, 
      action: Object

): (state: Object, action: Object) => newState: Object
```

See: https://redux.js.org/api-reference/combinereducers

```js
import { createReducer } from "reduced-utils";
import * as ActionTypes from "../constants/ActionTypes";

const initialState = {
    counter: 0
};

export const counterReducer = createReducer({
  [ActionTypes.INCREASE]: (state, {value = 1}) => ({...state, counter: state.counter + value}),
  [ActionTypes.DECREASE]: (state, {value = 1}) => ({...state, counter: state.counter - value})
}, initialState);
